# Automation Test Calculator Project
### Welcome to the Automation Test Calculator Project with Appium and Cucumber!   
The Automation Test Calculator Project is designed to help you get started with automated testing using Cucumber, Appium, Java, and JUnit. This project focuses on testing a simple calculator app within a clean architecture. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced tester, this guide provides a well-structured and maintainable setup for writing and executing automated tests.

## Features
- **Cucumber Framework Integration**: Learn how to create behavior-driven test scenarios using Gherkin syntax.
- **Appium Setup**: Understand how to configure Appium for mobile app testing.
- **Java and JUnit**: Explore Java-based test automation and utilize JUnit for test execution.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organize your test code in a modular and maintainable way.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started with the Automation Test Calculator Project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
- **Appium Installation**
- **Understanding of Cucumber and Gherkin Syntax**
- **JUnit (Java Unit Testing Framework)**

## Project Structure

### Java Folder

This folder contains all the Java code necessary for your automation tests. It's organized into several subfolders to maintain a clean architecture and ensure that your code is modular and maintainable.

- **hook**
    - Contains the classes that handle the setup and teardown of test environments.

- **core**
    - Includes the core functionalities and utilities needed for your tests.

- **steps**
    - Houses the step definition classes where you implement the steps defined in your Gherkin feature files.
      
### Resources Folder

This folder contains all the non-Java resources that your project needs, such as apps, feature files, and documentation.

- **apps**
    - Stores the mobile application files that you will be testing.
- **feature**
    - Contains the Cucumber feature files written in Gherkin syntax. These files define the behavior-driven test scenarios.
